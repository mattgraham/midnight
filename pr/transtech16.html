                <h2>Athens-based tech startup wins award at WVU tech and energy conference</h2>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><i>ATHENS, OH</i> &mdash; Athens-based startup Potential Labs was awarded the "Most Innovative Concept" at West Virginia University&#8217;s TransTech Energy Conference in Morgantown, W.Va.</p>
              <p>The two-day conference was devoted to bringing new environmental technology ideas and startup companies together with investors and partners. TransTech Energy brought 24 companies together to compete for awards from areas including power and carbon reduction technologies, biofuels, energy harvesting, robotics, building and engine efficiency, water treatment, electric vehicles and carbon capture.</p>
              <p>Potential Labs was awarded "Most Innovative Concept" for their prototype energy management device that consumers can use to monitor home energy use. Ben Lachman, Potential Labs&#8217; CEO, calls the device a &#8220;Fitbit for your home energy use.&#8221; Lachman says small businesses and homeowners can use the device to understand their energy usage qualitatively and in real-time, adding, &#8220;It gives you goals and attainable measures for optimizing how your home uses energy.&#8221;</p>
              <p>Potential Labs is riding a developing trend where users track and optimize their energy usage with devices from the smart home and home energy management systems (HEMS) markets. According to a report by GTM Research, the U.S. HEMS market is forecast to be worth more than $4 billion by 2017.</p>
              <p>&#8220;We were thrilled to have our unique technology recognized for its potential to increase efficiency in America&#8217;s homes and small businesses,&#8221; says Lachman. &#8220;When you consider the transition to sustainable energy, being more efficient really makes that transition more quickly achievable.&#8221;</p>
